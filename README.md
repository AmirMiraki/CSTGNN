📖 **Book Series:** *Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS, Volume 1903)*  

In this work, we introduce a **framework** that enhances the efficiency of **spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs)** for **Industrial IoT (IIoT) multivariate time series forecasting** by integrating **causality-based learning**.  

Our approach improves **model interpretability** by discovering **hidden relationships** between sensors, ensuring that deep learning decisions in **industrial time series forecasting** are both **accurate and explainable**. This is particularly crucial for **predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and process optimization** in industrial settings.
